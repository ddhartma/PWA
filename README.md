# Demo PWA with Flask, NodeJS, and Serverless Functions

This project is a simple demonstration of a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using Flask, Node.js, and serverless functions. The goal of this project is to showcase the capabilities of modern web technologies and serverless architectures.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Part 1 - Flask PWA with Python Backend Server**: This part involves creating a PWA with Flask and using a Python backend server to handle the API routes.

2. **Part 2 - NodeJS PWA with NodeJS Server**: In this part, another PWA is created with Node.js. The Node.js server is used to handle the API routes.

3. **Part 3 - Netlify PWA with Serverless Functions**: The third part of the project utilizes Netlify to create a PWA and serverless functions for backend processing.
